Theory (ANNCBT) forum, has compiled a large number of book and paper
reviews at

with an emphasis more on cognitive science rather than practical
applications of NNs.

<h4><a name="A_books_best_best">The best of the best</a></h4>

<a href="#A_books_best_bishop">Bishop (1995)</a> is clearly the single best
book on artificial NNs. This book excels in organization and choice of
material, and is a close runner-up to Ripley (1996) for accuracy.  If
you are new to the field, read it from cover to cover. If you have lots
of experience with NNs, it's an excellent reference. If you don't know
calculus, take a class. I hope a second edition comes out soon!
For more information, see

<h4><a name="A_books_best_business">The best introductory book for business executives</a></h4>

<a href="http://www.addall.com/New/BestSeller.cgi?isbn=0070057796">
Bigus, J.P. (1996), <cite>Data Mining with Neural Networks: Solving
Business Problems--from Application Development to Decision Support,</cite>
</a>
NY: McGraw-Hill, ISBN 0-07-005779-6, xvii+221 pages.<br>

The stereotypical business executive (SBE) does not want to know how
or why NNs work--he (SBEs are usually male) just wants to make money.
The SBE may know what an average or percentage is, but he is deathly
afraid of "statistics". He understands profit and loss but does not
want to waste his time learning things involving complicated math,
such as high-school algebra. For further information on the SBE, 
see the <a href="http://www.unitedmedia.com/comics/dilbert/">"Dilbert"</a>
comic strip. <p>

Bigus has written an excellent introduction to NNs for the SBE.  Bigus
says (p. xv), "For business executives, managers, or computer
professionals, this book provides a thorough introduction to neural
network technology and the issues related to its application without
getting bogged down in complex math or needless details. The reader will
be able to identify common business problems that are amenable to the
neural netwrk approach and will be sensitized to the issues that can
affect successful completion of such applications." Bigus succeeds in
explaining NNs at a practical, intuitive, and necessarily shallow level
without formulas--just what the SBE needs. This book is far better than
Caudill and Butler (1990), a popular but disastrous attempt
to explain NNs without formulas. <p>

Chapter 1 introduces data mining and data warehousing, and sketches
some applications thereof. Chapter 2 is the semi-obligatory
philosophico-historical discussion of AI and NNs and is well-written,
although the SBE in a hurry may want to skip it. Chapter 3 is a very
useful discussion of data preparation. Chapter 4 describes a variety
of NNs and what they are good for. Chapter 5 goes into practical
issues of training and testing NNs. Chapters 6 and 7 explain how to
use the results from NNs. Chapter 8 discusses intelligent agents.
Chapters 9 through 12 contain case histories of NN applications,
including market segmentation, real-estate pricing, customer ranking,
and sales forecasting. <p>

Bigus provides generally sound advice. He briefly discusses overfitting
and overtraining without going into much detail, although I think
his advice on p. 57 to have at least two training cases for each
connection is somewhat lenient, even for noise-free data. I do not
understand his claim on pp. 73 and 170 that RBF networks have
advantages over backprop networks for nonstationary inputs--perhaps
he is using the word "nonstationary" in a sense different from the
statistical meaning of the term. There are other things in the book
that I would quibble with, but I did not find any of the flagrant
errors that are common in other books on NN applications such as
Swingler (1996). <p>

The one serious drawback of this book is that it is more than one
page long and may therefore tax the attention span of the SBE. But
any SBE who succeeds in reading the entire book should learn enough
to be able to hire a good NN expert to do the real work. <p>

Review by Ian Cresswell: <p>
<blockquote>

What a relief! As a broad introductory text this is without any doubt
the best currently available in its area. It doesn't include source
code of any kind (normally this is badly written and compiler
specific). The algorithms for many different kinds of simple neural
nets are presented in a clear step by step manner in plain
English. <p> 

Equally, the mathematics is introduced in a relatively gentle
manner. There are no unnecessary complications or diversions from
the main theme. <p> 

The examples that are used to demonstrate the various algorithms
are detailed but (perhaps necessarily) simple. <p>  

There are bad things that can be said about most books. There are
only a small number of minor criticisms that can be made
about this one. More space should have been given to backprop
and its variants because of the practical importance of such
methods. And while the author discusses early stopping in one
paragraph, the treatment of generalization is skimpy compared to
the books by Weiss and Kulikowski or Smith listed above. <p>

If you're new to neural nets and you don't want to be swamped by
bogus ideas, huge amounts of intimidating looking mathematics, a
programming language that you don't know etc. etc. then this is the
book for you. <p> 

In summary, this is the best starting point for the outsider
and/or beginner... a truly excellent text.

Smith is not a statistician, but he has made an impressive effort to
convey statistical fundamentals applied to neural networks. The book has
entire brief chapters on overfitting and validation (early stopping and
split-sample validation, which he incorrectly calls
cross-validation), putting it a rung above most other introductions to
NNs. There are also brief chapters on data preparation and diagnostic
plots, topics usually ignored in elementary NN books. Only feedforward
nets are covered in any detail.<br>

Learning Laws; Weight Initialization; The Course of Learning: An
Example; Overfitting; Cross Validation; Preparing the Data; Representing

After you have read Smith (1996) or Weiss and Kulikowski (1991), consult
Reed and Marks for practical details on training MLPs (other types of
neural nets such as RBF networks are barely even mentioned). They
provide extensive coverage of backprop and its variants, and they also
survey conventional optimization algorithms. Their coverage of
initialization methods, constructive networks, pruning, and
regularization methods is unusually thorough.  Unlike the vast majority
of books on neural nets, this one has lots of really informative graphs.
The chapter on generalization assessment is slightly weak, which is why
you should read Smith (1996) or Weiss and Kulikowski (1991) first. Also,
there is little information on data preparation, for which Smith (1996)
and Masters (1993; see below) should be consulted. There is some
elementary calculus, but not enough that it should scare off anybody.
Many second-rate books treat neural nets as mysterious black boxes, but
Reed and Marks open up the box and provide genuine insight into the way
neural nets work. <p>

One problem with the book is that the terms "validation set"
and "test set" are used inconsistently. <p>

Masters has written three exceptionally good books on NNs (the two
others are listed below). He combines generally sound practical
advice with some basic statistical knowledge to produce a programming
text that is far superior to the competition (see "The Worst" below).
Not everyone likes his C++ code (the usual complaint is that the code
is not sufficiently OO) but, unlike the code in some other books,
Masters's code has been successfully compiled and run by some readers
of comp.ai.neural-nets. Masters's books are well worth reading even
for people who have no interest in programming. <br>

This is definitely the best book on feedforward neural nets for readers
comfortable with calculus. The book is exceptionally well organized,
presenting topics in a logical progression ideal for conceptual
understanding. <p>

Geoffrey Hinton writes in the foreword:<br>
"Bishop is a leading researcher who has a deep understanding of the
material and has gone to great lengths to organize it in a sequence that
makes sense. He has wisely avoided the temptation to try to cover
everything and has therefore omitted interesting topics like
reinforcement learning, Hopfield networks, and Boltzmann machines in
order to focus on the types of neural networks that are most widely used
in practical applications.  He assumes that the reader has the basic
mathematical literacy required for an undergraduate science degree, and
using these tools he explains everything from scratch.  Before
introducing the multilayer perceptron, for example, he lays a solid
foundation of basic statistical concepts. So the crucial concept of
overfitting is introduced using easily visualized examples of
one-dimensional polynomials and only later applied to neural networks.
An impressive aspect of this book is that it takes the reader all the
way from the simplest linear models to the very latest Bayesian
multilayer neural networks without ever requiring any great intellectual
leaps." <p>

This is an excellent classic work on neural nets from the perspective of
physics covering a wide variety of networks.
Comments from readers of comp.ai.neural-nets: "My first
impression is that this one is by far the best book on the topic. And
it's below $30 for the paperback."; "Well written, theoretical (but not
overwhelming)"; It provides a good balance of model development,
computational algorithms, and applications. The mathematical derivations
are especially well done"; "Nice mathematical analysis on the mechanism
of different learning algorithms"; "It is NOT for mathematical beginner.
If you don't have a good grasp of higher level math, this book can be
really tough to get through."<p>

Brian Ripley's book is an excellent sequel to Bishop (1995).  Ripley
starts up where Bishop left off, with Bayesian inference and statistical
decision theory, and then covers some of the same material on NNs as
Bishop but at a higher mathematical level.  Ripley also covers a variety
of methods that are not discussed, or discussed only briefly, by Bishop,
such as tree-based methods and belief networks. While Ripley is best
appreciated by people with a background in mathematical statistics, the
numerous realistic examples in his book will be of interest even to
beginners in neural nets.<br>

This book has relatively little material explicitly about neural nets,
but what it has is very interesting and much of it is not found in other
texts. The emphasis is on statistical proofs of universal consistency
for a wide variety of methods, including histograms, (k) nearest neighbors, kernels
(PNN), trees, generalized linear discriminants, MLPs, and RBF networks.
There is also considerable material on validation and cross-validation.
The authors say, "We did not scar the pages with backbreaking
simulations or quick-and-dirty engineering solutions" (p. 7).
The formula-to-text ratio is high, but the writing is quite
clear, and anyone who has had a year or two of mathematical statistics
should be able to follow the exposition.<br>

Brown and Harris rely on the fundamental insight that that a
fuzzy system is a nonlinear mapping from an input space to an output
space that can be parameterized in various ways and therefore can be
adapted to data using the usual neural training methods (see <a
href="FAQ2.html#A_backprop">"What is backprop?")</a> or conventional numerical
optimization algorithms (see <a href="FAQ2.html#A_numanal">"What are
conjugate gradients, Levenberg-Marquardt, etc.?").</a> Their approach
makes clear the intimate connections between fuzzy systems, neural
networks, and statistical methods such as B-spline regression.

<h4><a name="A_books_notable_general">General (including SVMs and Fuzzy Logic)</a></h4>

Many books on neural networks, machine learning, etc., present
various methods as miscellaneous tools without any conceptual
framework relating different methods. The best of such neural net
"cookbooks" is probably Haykin's (1999) second edition.<p>

Among conceptually-integrated books, there are two excellent books
that use the Vapnil-Chervonenkis theory as a unifying theme,
and provide strong coverage of support vector machines and fuzzy logic,
as well as neural nets. Of these two, Kecman (2001) provides clearer
explanations and better diagrams, but Cherkassky and Mulier (1998)
are better organized have an excellent section on unsupervised
learning, especially self-organizing maps. I have been tempted to
add both of these books to the "best" list, but I have not done so
because I think VC theory is of doubtful practical utility for
neural nets. However, if you are especially interested in VC theory
and support vector machines, then both of these books can be highly
recommended. To help you choose between them, a detailed table of
contents is provided below for each book. <p>

The second edition is much better than the first, which has been
described as a core-dump of Haykin's brain. The second edition covers
more topics, is easier to understand, and has better examples. <br>

<h4><a name="A_books_notable_oop">Object oriented programming</a></h4>

The FAQ maintainer is an old-fashioned C programmer and has no
expertise in object oriented programming, so he must rely on
the readers of comp.ai.neural-nets regarding the merits of
books on OOP for NNs. <p>

There are many excellent books about NNs by Timothy Masters (listed
elsewhere in the FAQ) that provide C++ code for NNs. If you simply
want code that works, these books should satisfy your needs.
If you want code that exemplifies the highest standards of

<blockquote>
A reviewer, a scientific programmer, July 19, 2000, ****  
Long explaination of neural net code - not of neural nets
Good OO code for simple 'off the shelf' implementation,
very open & fairly extensible for further cusomization.
A complete & lucid explanation of the code but pretty weak
on the principles, theory, and application of neural networks.
Great as a code source, disappointing as a neural network tutorial.

Bourlard, H.A., and Morgan, N. (1994),
<cite>Connectionist Speech Recognition: A Hybrid Approach,</cite>
</a>
Boston: Kluwer Academic Publishers, ISBN: 0792393961.<br>
From The Publisher:  Describes the theory and implementation of a method
to incorporate neural network approaches into state-of-the-art
continuous speech recognition systems based on Hidden Markov Models
(HMMs) to improve their performance. In this framework, neural networks
(and in particular, multilayer perceptrons or MLPs) have been restricted
to well-defined subtasks of the whole system, i.e., HMM emission
probability estimation and feature extraction. The book describes a
successful five year international collaboration between the authors.
The lessons learned form a case study that demonstrates how hybrid
systems can be developed to combine neural networks with more
traditional statistical approaches. The book illustrates both the
advantages and limitations of neural networks in the framework of a
statistical system. Using standard databases and comparing with some
conventional approaches, it is shown that MLP probability estimation can
improve recognition performance. Other approaches are discussed, though
there is no such unequivocal experimental result for these methods.
Connectionist Speech Recognition: A Hybrid Approach is of use to anyone
intending to use neural networks for speech recognition or within the
framework provided by an existing successful statistical approach. This
includes research and development groups working in the field of speech
recognition, both with standard and neural network approaches, as well
as other pattern recognition and/or neural network researchers. This
book is also suitable as a text for advanced courses on neural networks
or speech processing.

The authors try to translate mathematical formulas into English. The
results are likely to disturb people who appreciate either mathematics
or English. Have the authors never heard that "a picture is worth a
thousand words"?  What few diagrams they have (such as the one on p. 74)
tend to be confusing.  Their jargon is peculiar even by NN standards;
for example, they refer to target values as "mentor inputs" (p. 66).
The authors do not understand elementary properties of error functions
and optimization algorithms. For example, in their discussion of the
delta rule, the authors seem oblivious to the differences between batch
and on-line training, and they attribute magical properties to the
algorithm (p. 71):
<blockquote>
[The on-line delta] rule always takes the most efficient route from the
current position of the weight vector to the "ideal" position, based
on the current input pattern. The delta rule not only minimizes the
mean squared error, it does so in the most efficient fashion
possible--quite an achievement for such a simple rule.
</blockquote> 
While the authors realize that backpropagation networks can suffer
from local minima, they mistakenly think that counterpropagation has
some kind of global optimization ability (p. 202):
<blockquote> 
Unlike the backpropagation network, a counterpropagation network cannot
be fooled into finding a local minimum solution. This means that the
network is guaranteed to find the correct response (or the nearest
stored response) to an input, no matter what.
</blockquote> 
But even though they acknowledge the problem of local minima, the
authors are ignorant of the importance of initial weight values (p. 186):
<blockquote>
To teach our imaginary network something using backpropagation, we
must start by setting all the adaptive weights on all the neurodes
in it to random values. It won't matter what those values are, as
long as they are not all the same and not equal to 1.
</blockquote> 
Like most introductory books, this one
neglects the difficulties of getting good generalization--the authors
simply declare (p. 8) that "A neural network is able to generalize"!

Comments from readers of comp.ai.neural-nets: "The book was developed
out of a course on neural-network models with computer demonstrations
that was taught by the authors to Physics students. The book comes
together with a PC-diskette.  The book is divided into three parts:  (1)
Models of Neural Networks; describing several architectures and learing
rules, including the mathematics.  (2) Statistical Physics of Neural
Networks; "hard-core" physics section developing formal theories of
stochastic neural networks.  (3) Computer Codes; explanation about the
demonstration programs.  First part gives a nice introduction into
neural networks together with the formulas. Together with the
demonstration programs a 'feel' for neural networks can be developed."

Wasserman, P. D. (1989). <cite>Neural Computing: Theory & Practice.</cite>
Van Nostrand Reinhold: New York. (ISBN 0-442-20743-3) <br>
This is not as bad as some books on NNs. It provides an elementary
account of the mechanics of a variety of networks. But it provides
no insight into why various methods behave as they do, or under
what conditions a method will or will not work well. It has no
discussion of efficient training methods such as RPROP or
conventional numerical optimization techniques. And, most egregiously,
it has no explanation of overfitting and generalization beyond the
patently false statement on p. 2 that "It is important to note that
the artificial neural network generalizes automatically as a result
of its structure"! There is no mention of training, validation, and
test sets, or of other methods for estimating generalization error.
There is no practical advice on the important issue of choosing the
number of hidden units. There is no discussion of early stopping
or weight decay. The reader will come away from this book with a
grossly oversimplified view of NNs and no concept whatsoever of how
to use NNs for practical applications.
<p>
Comments from readers of comp.ai.neural-nets: "Wasserman flatly
enumerates some common architectures from an engineer's perspective
('how it works') without ever addressing the underlying fundamentals
('why it works') - important basic concepts such as clustering,
principal components or gradient descent are not treated.  It's also
full of errors, and unhelpful diagrams drawn with what appears to be PCB
board layout software from the '70s. For anyone who wants to do active
research in the field I consider it quite inadequate"; "Okay, but too
shallow"; "Quite easy to understand"; "The best bedtime reading for
Neural Networks.  I have given this book to numerous collegues who want
to know NN basics, but who never plan to implement anything.  An
excellent book to give your manager."<p>

<h4><a name="A_books_code_blum">Blum,</a>
Adam (1992), <cite>Neural Networks in C++</cite>, Wiley.</h4>

Review by Ian Cresswell. (For a review of the text, see
<a href="#A_books_worst_blum">"The Worst"</a> below.) <p>

   Mr Blum has not only contributed a masterpiece of NN inaccuracy
but also seems to lack a fundamental understanding of Object
Orientation. <p>

   The excessive use of virtual methods (see page 32 for
example), the inclusion of unnecessary 'friend' relationships (page
133) and a penchant for operator overloading (pick a page!)
demonstrate inability in C++ and/or OO. <p>

   The introduction to OO that is provided trivialises the area and
demonstrates a distinct lack of direction and/or understanding. <p>

   The public interfaces to classes are overspecified and the
design relies upon the flawed neuron/layer/network model. <p> 

   There is a notable disregard for any notion of a robust class
hierarchy which is demonstrated by an almost total lack of concern
for inheritance and associated reuse strategies. <p>

   The attempt to rationalise differing types of Neural Network into
a single very shallow but wide class hierarchy is naive. <p>

   The general use of the 'float' data type would cause serious
hassle if this software could possibly be extended to use some of
the more sensitive variants of backprop on more difficult
problems. It is a matter of great fortune that such software is
unlikely to be reusable and will therefore, like all good
dinosaurs, disappear with the passage of time. <p>

   The irony is that there is a card in the back of the book asking
the unfortunate reader to part with a further $39.95 for a copy of
the software (already included in print) on a 5.25" disk. <p>

   The author claims that his work provides an 'Object Oriented
Framework ...'.  This can best be put in his own terms (Page 137):

<h4><a name="A_books_code_swingler">Swingler,</a>
K. (1996), <cite>Applying Neural Networks: A Practical Guide,
</cite> London: Academic Press. </h4>

Review by Ian Cresswell. (For a review of the text, see
<a href="#A_books_worst_swingler">"The Worst"</a> below.) <p>

   Before attempting to review the code associated with this book
it should be clearly stated that it is supplied as an extra--almost
as an afterthought. This may be a wise move. <p>

   Although not as bad as other (even commercial) implementations,
the code provided lacks proper OO structure and is typical of C++
written in a C style. <p>

   Style criticisms include:
<ol>   
<li> The use of public data fields within classes (loss of
encapsulation). 
<li> Classes with no protected or private sections.
<li> Little or no use of inheritance and/or run-time polymorphism.
<li> Use of floats not doubles (a common mistake) to store values
     for connection weights.
<li> Overuse of classes and public methods. The network class has
     59 methods in its public section. 
<li> Lack of planning is evident for the construction of a class
     hierarchy. 
</ol>

   This code is without doubt written by a rushed C programmer. 
Whilst it would require a C++ compiler to be successfully used, it
lacks the tight (optimised) nature of good C and the high level of
abstraction of good C++. <p>
 
   In a generous sense the code is free and the author doesn't
claim any expertise in software engineering. It works in a limited
sense but would be difficult to extend and/or reuse. It's fine for
demonstration purposes in a stand-alone manner and for use with the
book concerned. <p>  

   If you're serious about nets you'll end up rewriting the whole
lot (or getting something better). <p>

<h4>How not to use neural nets in any programming language</h4>

   <a name="A_books_worst_blum">Blum,</a> 
   Adam (1992), <cite>Neural Networks in C++</cite>, NY: Wiley.
<dt><dd><p>
   Welstead, Stephen T. (1994), <cite>Neural Network and Fuzzy Logic
   Applications in C/C++</cite>, NY: Wiley.
</dl>

(For a review of Blum's source code, see
<a href="#A_books_code_blum">"Books with Source Code"</a> above.) <p>

Both Blum and Welstead contribute to the dangerous myth that any
idiot can use a neural net by dumping in whatever data are handy
and letting it train for a few days. They both have little or no
discussion of generalization, validation, and overfitting. Neither
provides any valid advice on choosing the number of hidden nodes.
If you have ever wondered where these stupid "rules of thumb" that
pop up frequently come from, here's a source for one of them:
<blockquote>
   "A rule of thumb is for the size of this [hidden] layer to be
   somewhere between the input layer size ... and the output layer
   size ..."  Blum, p. 60.
</blockquote>
(John Lazzaro tells me he recently "reviewed a paper that cited this rule of 
thumb--and referenced this book! Needless to say, the final version of that paper
didn't include the reference!") <p>

Blum offers some profound advice on choosing inputs:
<blockquote>
   "The next step is to pick as many input factors as possible that
   might be related to [the target]."
</blockquote>
Blum also shows a deep understanding of statistics:
<blockquote>
   "A statistical model is simply a more indirect way of learning
   correlations. With a neural net approach, we model the problem
   directly." p. 8.
</blockquote>
Blum at least mentions some important issues, however simplistic his
advice may be. Welstead just ignores them. What Welstead gives you is
code--vast amounts of code. I have no idea how anyone could write <em>that</em>
much code for a simple feedforward NN.  Welstead's approach to
validation, in his chapter on financial forecasting, is to reserve
<em>two</em> cases for the validation set!  <p>

My comments apply only to the text of the above books. I have not
examined or attempted to compile the code. <p>

<h4>An impractical guide to neural nets</h4>

<dl>
<dt><dd><p>
   <a name="A_books_worst_swingler">Swingler,</a>
    K. (1996), <cite>Applying Neural Networks: A Practical Guide,
   </cite> London: Academic Press. 
</dl>

(For a review of the source code, see
<a href="#A_books_code_swingler">"Books with Source Code"</a> above.) <p>

This book has lots of good advice liberally sprinkled with errors,
incorrect formulas, some bad advice, and some very serious mistakes.
Experts will learn nothing, while beginners will be unable to separate
the useful information from the dangerous. For example, there is a
chapter on "Data encoding and re-coding" that would be very useful to
beginners if it were accurate, but the formula for the standard
deviation is wrong, and the description of the softmax function is of
something entirely different than softmax (see 
<a href="FAQ2.html#A_softmax">What is a softmax activation function?).</a>
Even more dangerous is the statement on p. 28 that "Any pair of
variables with high covariance are dependent, and one may be chosen to
be discarded." Although high correlations can be used to identify
redundant inputs, it is incorrect to use high covariances for this
purpose, since a covariance can be high simply because one of the inputs
has a high standard deviation. <p>

The most ludicrous thing I've found in the book is the claim that
Hecht-Neilsen used Kolmogorov's theorem to show that "you will never
require more than twice the number of hidden units as you have inputs"
(p. 53) in an MLP with one hidden layer. Actually, Hecht-Neilsen, says
"the direct usefulness of this result is doubtful, because no
constructive method for developing the [output activation] functions is
known." Then Swingler implies that V. Kurkova (1991, "Kolmogorov's
theorem is relevant," Neural Computation, 3, 617-622) confirmed this
alleged upper bound on the number of hidden units, saying that, "Kurkova
was able to restate Kolmogorov's theorem in terms of a set of sigmoidal
functions." If Kolmogorov's theorem, or Hecht-Nielsen's adaptation of
it, could be restated in terms of known sigmoid activation functions in
the (single) hidden and output layers, then Swingler's alleged upper
bound would be correct, but in fact no such restatement of Kolmogorov's
theorem is possible, and Kurkova did not claim to prove any such
restatement.  Swingler omits the crucial details that Kurkova used two
hidden layers, staircase-like activation functions (not ordinary
sigmoidal functions such as the logistic) in the first hidden layer, and
a potentially large number of units in the second hidden layer. Kurkova
later estimated the number of units required for uniform approximation
within an error <tt>epsilon</tt> as <tt>nm(m+1)</tt> in the first hidden
layer and <tt>m^2(m+1)^n</tt> in the second hidden layer, where
<tt>n</tt> is the number of inputs and <tt>m</tt> "depends on
<tt>epsilon/||f||</tt> as well as on the rate with which <tt>f</tt>
increases distances." In other words, Kurkova says nothing to support
Swinglers advice (repeated on p. 55), "Never choose h to be more than
twice the number of input units." Furthermore, constructing a counter
example to Swingler's advice is trivial: use one input and one output,
where the output is the sine of the input, and the domain of the input
extends over many cycles of the sine wave; it is obvious that many more
than two hidden units are required.
For some sound information on choosing the number of hidden units, see
<a href="FAQ3.html#A_hu">How many hidden units should I use?</a> <p>

Choosing the number of hidden units is one important aspect of getting
good generalization, which is the most crucial issue in neural network
training. There are many other considerations involved in getting good
generalization, and Swingler makes several more mistakes in this area:

<ul>

<li>
There is dangerous misinformation on p. 55, where Swingler
says, "If a data set contains no noise, then there is no risk of
overfitting as there is nothing to overfit." It is true that overfitting
is more common with noisy data, but severe overfitting can occur with
noise-free data, even when there are more training cases than weights.
There is an example of such overfitting under 
<a href="FAQ3.html#A_hl">How many hidden layers should I use?</a> <p>

<li>
Regarding the use of added noise (jitter) in training, Swingler says on
p. 60, "The more noise you add, the more general your model becomes."
This statement makes no sense as it stands (it would make more sense if
"general" were changed to "smooth"), but it could certainly encourage a
beginner to use far too much jitter--see 
<a href="FAQ3.html#A_jitter">What is jitter? (Training with noise).</a> <p>

<li>
On p. 109, Swingler describes leave-one-out cross-validation, which
he ascribes to Hecht-Neilsen. But Swingler concludes, "the method
provides you with L minus 1 networks to choose from; none of which
has been validated properly," completely missing the point that
cross-validation provides an estimate of the generalization error
of a network trained on the entire training set of L cases--see
<a href="FAQ3.html#A_cross">What are cross-validation and bootstrapping?</a>
Also, there are L leave-one-out networks, not L-1. <p>

</ul>

While Swingler has some knowldege of statistics, his expertise is not
sufficient for him to detect that certain articles on neural nets are
statistically nonsense. For example, on pp. 139-140 he uncritically
reports a method that allegedly obtains error bars by doing a simple
linear regression on the target vs. output scores. To a trained
statistician, this method is obviously wrong (and, as usual in this
book, the formula for variance given for this method on p. 150 is
wrong). On p. 110, Swingler reports an article that attempts to apply
bootstrapping to neural nets, but this article is also obviously wrong
to anyone familiar with bootstrapping. While Swingler cannot be blamed
entirely for accepting these articles at face value, such misinformation
provides yet more hazards for beginners. <p>

Swingler addresses many important practical issues, and often provides
good practical advice. But the peculiar combination of much
good advice with some extremely bad advice, a few examples of which are
provided above, could easily seduce a beginner into thinking that
the book as a whole is reliable. It is this danger that earns the book
a place in "The Worst" list. <p>

This book, allegedly an expose of bad science, contains only one chapter

egregiously misleading that the book has earned a place on "The Worst"

Remark:  One way to cope with the exponential increase in the number
         of articles published in recent years is to ignore most of
         them. A second, perhaps more satisfying, approach is to
         provide a forum that encourages the regular production --
         and perusal -- of high-quality survey articles. This is
         especially useful in an inter-disciplinary, evolving field
         such as neural networks. This journal aims to bring the
         second view-point to bear. It is intended to

         * encourage researchers to write good survey papers. 
         * motivate researchers to look here first to check
           what's known on an unfamiliar topic.

Title:   The Behavioral and Brain Sciences
Publish: Cambridge University Press
Remark:  (Remarks by Don Wunsch <dwunsch@blake.acs.washington.edu>
         This is a delightful journal that encourages discussion on a
         variety of controversial topics.  I have especially enjoyed
         reading some papers in there by Dana Ballard and Stephen
         Grossberg (separate papers, not collaborations) a few years
         back.  They have a really neat concept: they get a paper,
         then invite a number of noted scientists in the field to
         praise it or trash it.  They print these commentaries, and
         give the author(s) a chance to make a rebuttal or
         concurrence.  Sometimes, as I'm sure you can imagine, things
         get pretty lively. Their reviewers are called something like
         Behavioral and Brain Associates, and I believe they have to
         be nominated by current associates, and should be fairly
         well established in the field. The main thing is that I liked
         the articles I read.

<H2>Subject: <a name="A_how_to_bench">How to benchmark learning methods?</a></H2>

The NN benchmarking resources page at
<a href="http://wwwipd.ira.uka.de/~prechelt/NIPS_bench.html">http://wwwipd.ira.uka.de/~prechelt/NIPS_bench.html</a>
was created after a NIPS 1995 workshop on NN benchmarking.  The page
contains pointers to various papers on proper benchmarking methodology
and to various sources of datasets. <p>

Benchmark studies require some familiarity with the statistical
design and analysis of experiments. There are many textbooks on this
subject, of which Cohen (1995) will probably be of particular interest
to researchers in neural nets and machine learning (see also the
review of Cohen's book by Ron Kohavi in the International Journal of 
Neural Systems, which can be found on-line at 
<a href="http://robotics.stanford.edu/users/ronnyk/ronnyk-bib.html">http://robotics.stanford.edu/users/ronnyk/ronnyk-bib.html</a>).

   </ul>
   Here are example descriptions of two of these databases:
      <H4>NIST special database 2:
        Structured Forms Reference Set (SFRS)</H4>
        The NIST database of structured forms contains 5,590 full page images
        of simulated tax forms completed using machine print. THERE IS NO REAL
        TAX DATA IN THIS DATABASE. The structured forms used in this database
        are 12 different forms from the 1988, IRS 1040 Package X. These
        include Forms 1040, 2106, 2441, 4562, and 6251 together with Schedules
        A, B, C, D, E, F and SE.  Eight of these forms contain two pages or
        form faces making a total of 20 form faces represented in the
        database.  Each image is stored in bi-level black and white raster
        format.  The images in this database appear to be real forms prepared
        by individuals but the images have been automatically derived and
        synthesized using a computer and contain no "real" tax data. The entry
        field values on the forms have been automatically generated by a
        computer in order to make the data available without the danger of
        distributing privileged tax information.  In addition to the images
        the database includes 5,590 answer files, one for each image. Each
        answer file contains an ASCII representation of the data found in the
        entry fields on the corresponding image. Image format documentation
        and example software are also provided.  The uncompressed database
        totals approximately 5.9 gigabytes of data.

      <H4>NIST special database 3:
        Binary Images of Handwritten Segmented Characters (HWSC)</H4>
        Contains 313,389 isolated character images segmented from the
        2,100 full-page images distributed with "NIST Special Database 1".
        223,125 digits, 44,951 upper-case, and 45,313 lower-case character
        images. Each character image has been centered in a separate
        128 by 128 pixel region, error rate of the segmentation and
        assigned classification is less than 0.1%.
        The uncompressed database totals approximately 2.75 gigabytes of
        image data and includes image format documentation and example
        software.<p>

      The system requirements for all databases are a 5.25" CD-ROM drive
      with software to read ISO-9660 format.

   in high resolution grayscale (300  ppi 8-bit)  as  well  as
   binary handwritten digits and alphabetic characters (300 ppi
   1-bit).  This database is intended to encourage research  in
   off-line  handwriting  recognition  by  providing  access to
   handwriting samples  digitized  from  envelopes in a working
   post office.
<pre>
     Specifications of the database include:
     +    300 ppi 8-bit grayscale handwritten words (cities,
          states, ZIP Codes)
          o    5632 city words
          o    4938 state words
          o    9454 ZIP Codes
     +    300 ppi binary handwritten characters and digits:
          o    27,837 mixed alphas  and  numerics  segmented
               from address blocks
          o    21,179 digits segmented from ZIP Codes
     +    every image supplied with  a  manually  determined
          truth value
     +    extracted from live mail in a  working  U.S.  Post
          Office
     +    word images in the test  set  supplied  with  dic-
          tionaries  of  postal  words that simulate partial
          recognition of the corresponding ZIP Code.
     +    digit images included in test  set  that  simulate
          automatic ZIP Code segmentation.  Results on these
          data can be projected to overall ZIP Code recogni-
          tion performance.
     +    image format documentation and software included
</pre>
   System requirements are a 5.25" CD-ROM drive with software to read
   ISO-9660 format.

<li><H3> <a name="A_data_faces">USENIX Faces</a></H3>
 The USENIX faces archive is a public database, accessible by ftp, that
 can be of use to people working in the fields of human face recognition,
 classification and the like. It currently contains 5592 different faces
 (taken at USENIX conferences) and is updated twice each year. The images
 are mostly 96x128 greyscale frontal images and are stored in ascii files
 in a way that makes it easy to convert them to any usual graphic format
 (GIF, PCX, PBM etc.). Source code for viewers, filters, etc. is
 provided. Each image file takes approximately 25K. <P>

 For further information, see
 <A HREF="http://facesaver.usenix.org/">http://facesaver.usenix.org/</A><p>

 According to the archive administrator, Barbara L. Dijker
 (barb.dijker@labyrinth.com), there is no restriction to use them.
 However, the image files are stored in separate directories
 corresponding to the Internet site to which the person represented in
 the image belongs, with each directory containing a small number of
 images (two in the average). This makes it difficult to retrieve by ftp
 even a small part of the database, as you have to get each one
 individually.<br>
 A solution, as Barbara proposed me, would be to compress the whole set
 of images (in separate files of, say, 100 images) and maintain them as a
 specific archive for research on face processing, similar to the ones
 that already exist for fingerprints and others. The whole compressed
 database would take some 30 megabytes of disk space. I encourage anyone
 willing to host this database in his/her site, available for anonymous
 ftp, to contact her for details (unfortunately I don't have the
 resources to set up such a site). <P>

 Please consider that UUNET has graciously provided the ftp server for
 the FaceSaver archive and may discontinue that service if it becomes a
 burden. This means that people should not download more than maybe 10
 faces at a time from uunet. <P>

 A last remark: each file represents a different person (except for
 isolated cases). This makes the database quite unsuitable for training
 neural networks, since for proper generalisation several instances of
 the same subject are required. However, it is still useful for use as
 testing set on a trained network. <P>
